### Project:  
To Build an affordable, DIY Heads-Up Display for Motorcyclists


### Project Goal:
To encourage young people to wear helmets by appealing their sense of technology with a helmet HUD




### Description:  

A helmet fitted with a microprocessor(+Bluetooth), a display and an assortment of mirrors and acrylic glasses.  
A modern motorbike fitted with an OBD2 scanner having bluetooth connectivity.


The ECU is the brains of the bike. It communicates with many onboard sensors such as
-Crank Position sensors  
-Engine Oil Temperature sensor  
-Gear Position sensor  
-Intake Air Temperature sensor  
And many more  

The aim is to use a microprocessor to communicate with the brains of the bike and request useful information to be displayed to the rider.  
The basic important information required for the rider would be:  
-Speed  
-Engine RPM and  
-Gear Position  

The tiny OLED display (0.96inches)  is to be placed on the chin section of the helmet. Using mirrors and acrylic glasses, an image of the display can be reflected from the acrylic glass. This process is exactly the same how tele-prompeters work.
